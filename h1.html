   Dr. Abdul Kalam had to sell newspapers in his early childhood to run his 
   family, but he was a hardworking and sharp student. He started his schooling 
   from Schwartz Higher School in Ramanathapuram. He then moved on to complete 
   his graduation in physics from the University of Madras and after that to study 
   aerospace technology from the Madras Institute of Technology. Dr. Kalam started 
   his career as a scientist from the Aeronautical Development Establishment of 
   DRDO and worked under the eminent scientist Vikram Sarabhai. He started his 
   contribution as a scientist in 1969 when he was the project director of India’s 
   first satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) was used to launch the satellite 
   Rohini in 1980 and is considered the developer of the Polar Satellite Launch 
   Vehicle. He also played a crucial role in the development of Agni and Prithvi
   missiles. Dr. Kalam was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister 
   in 1992 when the Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted. In 2002, 
   Dr. Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India. He had received the 
   title of ‘People’s President.’ During his tenure as President, he had rejected 
   the mercy plea of the Dhananjoy Chatterjee, convicted of brutal rape and murder.
   He was only the third President to be awarded the Bharat Ratna. He also imposed 
   President’s rule in Bihar in 2005. However, he did not file for Presidency for 
   a second term and instead returned to the field of academics and continued to 
   do so till his death in 2015.

   "If you fail, never give up because F.A.I.L. means "First Attempt In Learning". 
   End is not the end, if fact E.N.D. means "Effort Never Dies." If you get No as

    He was the writer of various motivational books like "India 2010", 
    "Touched off Minds", "Mission India", "The Luminous Sparks", 
    "Wings of Fire", and "Moving Thoughts".
    His life, work, and convictions are loaded up with models and motivations. 
    He will keep on inspiring us for eternity. Furthermore, this is the genuine 
    justification for why individuals from every one of the segments of the 
    general public precipitously show love for this incredible person on his 
    miserable end at IIM Shillong on 27th July 2015.
    May this Noble and faithful Soul find happiness in the hereafter!
